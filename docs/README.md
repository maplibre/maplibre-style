# Introduction

A MapLibre style is a document that defines the visual appearance of a map: what data to draw, the order to draw it in, and how to style the data when drawing it. A style document is a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) object with specific root level and nested properties. This specification defines and describes these properties.

The intended audience of this specification includes:

-   Advanced designers and cartographers who want to write styles by hand.
-   Developers using style-related features of [MapLibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) or the [MapLibre Native for Android and iOS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native).
-   Authors of software that generates or processes MapLibre styles.

## Style document structure

A MapLibre style consists of a set of [root properties](./root.md), some of which describe a single global property, and some of which contain nested properties. Some root properties, like [`version`](root.md#version), [`name`](root.md#name), and [`metadata`](root.md#metadata), donâ€™t have any influence over the appearance or behavior of your map, but provide important descriptive information related to your map. Others, like [`layers`](./layers.md) and [`sources`](./sources.md), are critical and determine which map features will appear on your map and what they will look like. Some properties, like [`center`](root.md#center), [`zoom`](root.md#zoom), [`pitch`](root.md#pitch), and [`bearing`](root.md#bearing), provide the map renderer with a set of defaults to be used when initially displaying the map.
